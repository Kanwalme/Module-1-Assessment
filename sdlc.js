    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const design = "This is step 3. This steps is used to model the way a software appliation will work, such as what technologies will be used and what data structures will be used to store data. ";
const implementation = "This is step 4. In this step, the program is being written.";
